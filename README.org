329 CpGs with error of 3.33 weeks. Tissues include liver, muscle, spleen and cerebellum samples.

This paper focused on liver methylomes and found aging is slowed by Prop1^{df/df} dwarfism, rapamycin treatment and calori restriction. The clock was built from liver methylomes of mice from 0.2 to 26.0 months old.

435 CpGs built.

Four clocks were built. Two used 193,651 CpGs and two used 952 CpGs
